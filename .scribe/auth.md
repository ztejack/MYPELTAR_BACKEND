# Authenticating requests

To authenticate requests, include a **`MYP_API_KEY`** header with the value **`"{YOUR_AUTH_KEY}"`**.

All authenticated endpoints are marked with a `requires authentication` badge in the documentation below.

You can retrieve your token by visiting your dashboard and clicking <b>Generate API token</b>.
